Rail-RNA-align_readlets

Follows Rail-RNA-align_reads
Precedes Rail-RNA-junction_search

Alignment script for MapReduce pipelines that wraps Bowtie. Aligns input
readlet sequences and writes a single output line per readlet belonging to
a distinct read sequence. THIS CODE ASSUMES THAT BOWTIE RUNS ON JUST ONE
THREAD; it exploits that Bowtie returns reads in the order in which they were
sent, which is guaranteed only when on a single thread.

Input (read from stdin)
----------------------------
Tab-delimited input tuple columns:
1. Readlet sequence or its reversed complement, whichever is first in
    alphabetical order
2.  read sequence ID + ('-' if readlet sequence is
    reverse-complemented; else '+') + '\x1e' + displacement of readlet's 5' end
    from read's 5' end + '\x1e' + displacement of readlet's 3' end from read's
    3' end (+, for EXACTLY one readlet of a read sequence, '\x1e' +
    read sequence + '\x1e' + (an '\x1f'-separated list A of unique sample
    labels with read sequences that match the original read sequence) + '\x1e'
    + (an '\x1f'-separated list  of unique sample labels B with read sequences
    that match the reversed complement of the original read sequence))] + 
    '\x1e' + (an '\x1f'-separated list of the number of instances of the read
    sequence for each respective sample in list A) + '\x1e' + (an
    '\x1f'-separated list of the number of instances of the read
    sequence's reversed complement for each respective sample in list B)].
    Here, a read sequence ID takes the form X:Y, where X is the
    "mapred_task_partition" environment variable -- a unique index for a task
    within a job -- and Y is the index of the read sequence relative to the
    beginning of the input stream.

Input is partitioned by field 1, the readlet sequence or its reversed
complement.

Hadoop output (written to stdout)
----------------------------
Tab-delimited output tuple columns, where each line corresponds to a readlet
from a distinct read rather than a unique readlet sequence:
1. Read sequence ID
2. Displacement of readlet's 5' end from read's 5' end + '\x1e' +
    displacement of readlet's 3' end from read's 3' end (+, for EXACTLY one
    readlet of a read sequence, '\x1e' + read sequence + '\x1e' + number of
    instances of read sequence + '\x1e' + number of instances of read
    sequence's reversed complement + '\x1e' (+, for EXACTLY one readlet of a
    read sequence, '\x1e' + read sequence + '\x1e' + (an '\x1f'-separated list
    A of unique sample labels with read sequences that match the original read
    sequence) + '\x1e' + (an '\x1f'-separated list  of unique sample labels B
    with read sequences that match the reversed complement of the original read
    sequence))] + '\x1e' + (an '\x1f'-separated list of the number of instances
    of the read sequence for each respective sample in list A) + '\x1e' + (an
    '\x1f'-separated list of the number of instances of the read sequence's
    reversed complement for each respective sample in list B)
3. '\x1f'-separated list of alignment RNAMEs or '\x1c' if no alignments found
4. '\x1f'-separated list of alignment FLAGs or '\x1c' if no alignments found
5. '\x1f'-separated list of alignment POSes or '\x1c' if no alignments found
